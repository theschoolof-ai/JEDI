| *DNN Concepts*: Convolutions, Pooling Operations & Channels  |
| *PyTorch*: Pytorch 101 for Vision Machine Learning           |
| *First Neural Network*: Kernels, Activations, and Layers     |
| *Architectural Basics*: We go through 9 model iterations together, step-by-step to find the final architecture |
| *Receptive Fields*: The CORE fundamental concept behind EVA Program |
| *BN, Kernels & Regularization*: Mathematics behind Batch Normalization, Kernel Initialization, and Regularization |
| *Backpropagation and Advance Convolutions*: Depthwise, Pixel Shuffle, Dilated, Transpose and others |
| *Advanced Image Augmentation Techniques*: Albumentations, Richman's data augmentation and benchmarks |
